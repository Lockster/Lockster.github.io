	<h1> Welcome to LGR a.k.a LocksterGearReview </h1> 
	<p> This is all about bushcrafting outdoors and wildness living. This is yout host Loc Nguyen. Here at LocksterGearReview, I take gear that I have tested and have brought with my own money and review the gear to show and tell you the reader or viewer if it is a great gear to buy. But, I also do some "How to videos of bushcrafting"to show the viewers on HowTo on gear.

	<h2>LocksterGearReview</h2>
	<p>At LocksterGearReview, I you host focus on the importance of survival in the great outdoors. Here I go to the outdoors and test the gears and do "How To Videos" to show the viewers the things LGR is focus on. My philosphy is that more people should be going outdoors more and learn the skills that their ancestors use to survive on the plant without mordern day technology. But, I think that any technology that help a person to survive in the great outdoors is acceptable.
