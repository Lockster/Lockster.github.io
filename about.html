	<p> LocksterGearReview is a youtube channal that was created for the intended purpose of teaching others about bushcrafting from ateenager point of view. LGR (LocksterGearView) started in the first month of 2015 but was in the thinking process from 2007 to 2014. LocksterGearReview is hosted by Loc Nguyen, codename Lockster. This website is to let people see the upcoming events of the youtube channal: Lockster Gear Review but also allow the people to comment on current events and suggest gear review. Within the next few years, I will be take LocksterGearReview to the next level. Im hoping to teach many people about bushcraft and show people my point of view of gear that is reviewed on the channal.
